React Material UI kit (only grid components & couple of others)<br />

***Install***<br />
clone<br />
npm install<br />
npm start<br />

***Comments***<br />
- I can do this task without ui kits + use CSS3.<br />
- I can do this task use only HTML + CSS + JS<br />
- Initial state of posts was ordered by "createTime" key (as from server side response)<br />


***Problem 1***<br />
If we see block "posts list" in model on figma.com, we can see 3 types of post:<br />
1. Post with text<br />
2. Post with picture<br />
3. Post with statistic<br />
Model on figma.com doesn't have modal form (post add form) for type of post #3.<br />

***Problem 2***<br />
Titles etc. "Highlights" and "Projects statuses" have a different margin on model<br />
"Top specialization" - labels have "font-family: Lato;"
