React Material UI kit (only grid components & couple of others)

* Install *
clone ...
npm install
npm start

* Comments *
- I can do this task without ui kits + use CSS3.
- I can do this task use only HTML + CSS + JS
- Initial state of posts was ordered by "createTime" key (as from server side response)

* Problem 1 *
If we see block "posts list" in model on figma.com, we can see 3 types of post:
1. Post with text
2. Post with picture
3. Post with statistic
Model on figma.com doesn't have modal form (post add form) for type of post #3.

* Problem 2 *
Titles etc. "Highlights" and "Projects statuses" have a different margin on model
"Top specialization" - labels have "font-family: Lato;"
