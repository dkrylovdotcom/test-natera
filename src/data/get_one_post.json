What if a patient could put aside the pamphlets and actually see the impact a diet would have on his or her future appearance? What if impaired mobility patients could experience brain- and coordination-building activities in complete safety?</p><p>Immersive \"digital reality\" tools such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are making these scenarios increasingly realistic. As with many earlier technology waves, VR and AR got an early boost from frivolous uses and are graduating to more constructive roles. Barriers to technology, cost, and content are beginning to fall, and early adopters are already hard at work.</p>",
